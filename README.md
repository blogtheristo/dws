#### Architecture definition for Project Montreux  

Project Montreux Build is Cloud Native platform, is created with Serverless First Design principles,  is built as a set of resilient distributed applications and their functions that are loosely coupled microservices that are   developed and executed on multiple cloud platforms (Partners, Customers; on premises, Microsoft Azure, AWS, IBM Cloud, and so on). 

Project Montreux applications are written in various coding languages.  
(Python, Go, JavaScript, YAML, JSON, Solidity) which are managed with Dapr.  
Dapr is focused on helping developers build distributed applications,  
and it does not replace Service Meshes.  
Both Dapr and service meshes use the sidecar pattern and run alongside the application.  

Project Montreux has Event Driven Architecture that uses APIs.
